This MATLAB script models the thermal structure of an oceanic plate as it ages and moves away from a mid-ocean ridge. The code calculates and plots the depth at which different isotherms (temperatures) occur within the plate over time.

It uses the error function (erfinv) to simulate the depth profiles for temperatures ranging from 473K to 1273K and compares these profiles with actual earthquake depth data. The plot generated displays isotherms against distance from the ridge and overlays earthquake depths for comparison, illustrating the thermal evolution of the oceanic lithosphere.
